# Machine Learning 3 - Deep Learning Project
#### Unsupervised clustering of songs into genres based on their musical features (without lyrics). Annotated found “genres” based on their musical profile and then utilized Spotify’s API to generate a playlist from each cluster of genres and send these to my Spotify account. Utilized K-means clustering, Gaussian Mixed Model clustering, and HDBSCAN.
